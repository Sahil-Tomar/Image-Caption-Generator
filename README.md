# Image Caption Generator using Deep Learning
-  Developed an image captioning model combining **Convolutional Neural Network** for feature extraction (with a pre-trained
**DenseNet201** model) and **Long short-term memory (LSTM) Network** for sequential text generation using Flikr8K dataset.
-  Enhanced the original image captioning model by integrating image embeddings, improving performance over the baseline
